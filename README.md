## Key Features

- Intelligent code suggestions based on the developer's current context.
- Auto-generation of code snippets to speed up workflows.
- Real-time integration with AI language models.
- Interactive terminal interface for easy use and navigation.
- Compatible with macOS and easily extendable.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- macOS Terminal as the base CLI interface.
- Backend engine developed in Python/Node.js to handle AI requests.
